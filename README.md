# 🍃 Potato Leaf Disease Detection using CNN and Streamlit

This project is a deep learning-based web application built using **Streamlit** that identifies potato leaf diseases. Upload an image of a potato leaf and the model will classify it as either:

- ✅ **Healthy**
- 🌿 **Early Blight**
- 🌫️ **Late Blight**
